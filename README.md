# Pourover
Utility for making Pourovers.

# Future Features
* iOS/Android Parity
* Experimentation page where users can record coffee's, grams, ratios, notes, etc.
* FourSixProducer updates to support sliding values
  * Currently, 0.4167 and 0.5833 are hardcoded for sweetness Sweeter and Brighter. It would be nice
  * to have FourSixProducer support custom values for these so we can eventually introduce a slider
  * in the UI that the user can control. The slider would have "bumps" for 0.4167 and 0.5833 instead.

# Immediate Goals
* Get iOS up and running with the Multiplatform UI(convert to Swift UI for the long term)
